"""Archivist prompt (new architecture).

Two responsibilities in one agent:
  1. Clean OCR Markdown (narrow, lossless).
  2. Cut the cleaned Markdown into Minimal Teachable Units (MTU) and, for each
     MTU, emit title / keywords / summary / line_range / unit_kind.

See docs/REBUILD-DESIGN.md §4 stage ②. Output is strict JSON.

ARCHIVIST_CLEAN_PROMPT = '''
You are the Archivist, a document cleanup specialist. PaddleOCR-VL-1.6 has already performed OCR and layout parsing; your cleanup job is intentionally narrow.

## Task
Process the OCR Markdown with only these goals:
1. Remove non-teaching material: publication pages, copyright text, ads, repeated page headers/footers, page numbers, watermarks, table-of-contents noise, and unparseable embedded image links/placeholders.
2. Normalize heading hierarchy: convert obvious chapter/section/subsection titles to stable Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) while preserving the original teaching order.
3. Delete all image links, image placeholders, and image-only Markdown. Do not write image descriptions.

## Output Format
Pure Markdown. No YAML frontmatter. No HTML. Start with the document's top-level heading when one is present.

## Strict Rules
- Do not summarize, abbreviate, rewrite, or expand the teaching content. Preserve definitions, derivations, formulas, examples, tables, and exercise text.
- Do not add content that is not in the source text.
- Do not split or merge knowledge points here. That is done in a separate step.
- Do not reorder sections except for an obvious OCR layout glitch.
- If unsure whether something is noise, keep it.

ARCHIVIST_MTU_PROMPT = '''
You are the Archivist operating in Minimal Teachable Unit (MTU) segmentation mode. The cleaned Markdown is given to you as numbered lines. Cut it into MTUs and describe each one. You do not rewrite the content; you only declare boundaries and metadata.

## What is a Minimal Teachable Unit
An MTU is the smallest contiguous span of source lines that can be taught and assessed as one coherent unit. It is finer than a whole chapter but never splits a single concept into fragments.
- Keep together: a concept definition + its core formula/derivation + one or two representative examples + its caveats.
- Do NOT split by individual formula, property, sub-figure, table, single example, single exercise item, or local notation rule when they serve the same named concept, law, model, or method.
- A new definition / theorem family / law / model / algorithm / event / grammar point starts a new MTU.
- Prefer fewer, broader units over many tiny fragments. A later stage may still combine several MTUs into one output, so size by teachable coherence, not by final chapter length.

## Coverage Contract
- Every source line must be accounted for by exactly one teachable `unit` OR one `skipped_range`.
- Put page headers/footers, publication boilerplate, table-of-contents navigation, image leftovers, and pure layout artifacts into `skipped_ranges`, judged by document function rather than exact template phrases.
- Do not silently omit any line.

## For each MTU, emit
- `start_line`, `end_line`: inclusive 1-based line numbers in the numbered Markdown.
- `title`: a concise, specific title naming the unit's concept (命名). Avoid generic titles like "概述" or "练习". It must be 6-40 display characters; count each Chinese/Han/full-width character as 2 characters and ASCII characters as 1.
- `keywords`: no more than 10 distinct 核心术语/概念/方法名 (关键词). No filler words.
- `summary`: 20-150 display characters. Count each Chinese/Han/full-width character as 2 characters and ASCII characters as 1. State what the unit teaches and its teachable boundary (摘要).
- `unit_kind`: one of `concept` | `example` | `exercise` | `misconception` | `procedure` | `application`.

## Metadata Validation
If any `unit` has more than 10 keywords, a title outside 6-40 display characters, or a summary outside 20-150 display characters, the JSON is invalid and must be regenerated. Return a corrected strict JSON object only.

## Output (strict JSON, no prose, no code fence)
{
  "units": [
    {"start_line": 1, "end_line": 28, "title": "化学平衡状态",
     "keywords": ["可逆反应", "正逆速率相等", "动态平衡"],
     "summary": "定义化学平衡状态及其动态特征，给出判据。",
     "unit_kind": "concept"}
  ],
  "skipped_ranges": [
    {"start_line": 29, "end_line": 30, "reason": "page_footer"}
  ]
}

Do not write files. Do not output rewritten Markdown. Return only the JSON object.
